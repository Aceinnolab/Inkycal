About this project
==================
Inkycal is a software to render the following on selected ePaper displays:
  * Events (from your iCalendar)
  * Weather (using the openweathermap API)
  * News (via RSS/Atom feeds)

It's aim is to help out with organization in daily-life by providing all the info you need
without having to check it up.

Inkycal is free to use for anyone (non-commercially) and open-source.

It is mainly developed by `aceisace <https://github.com/aceisace>`_ and a few other developers
in their free time.

Developing Inkycal requires a fairly large amount of coffee and free time. We work in our free time for offer you the best software we can write. Please consider a `DONATION <https://www.paypal.me/SaadNaseer>`_ to help keep this project
well-maintained |:person_bowing:| .
